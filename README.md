# MKS66-line
My own line algorithm!  
Frameworks for both c and python, these can be found here: https://github.com/mks66/66source/tree/master/line  
Started with octant 1, added the other octants one at a time.  
Code results in displaying an image that tests all octants, including slopes of 0, 1, -1 and undefended.
